## 🎯 Purpose

This project transforms Google's Gemini AI into a **comprehensive development assistant** that can understand natural language instructions and execute complex development tasks through an extensive toolkit. It bridges the gap between conversational AI and practical development work.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

### Challenges in Modern Development

1. **Context Switching Overhead**: Developers constantly switch between:
   - Code editors
   - Terminal commands
   - Git operations
   - File management
   - Documentation lookup
   - System monitoring

2. **Repetitive Tasks**: Common operations like:
   - File manipulation (read, write, search)
   - Git workflows (status, commit, push)
   - Code analysis (syntax checking, TODOs)
   - Data processing (JSON, CSV parsing)
   
3. **Tool Fragmentation**: Different tools for different tasks:
   - Shell scripts for automation
   - Git commands for version control
   - Text editors for file editing
   - Archive utilities for compression
   - System monitors for resource checking

4. **Cognitive Load**: Remembering:
   - Command syntax and flags
   - File paths and locations
   - Git commands and workflows
   - Regex patterns for text processing

## 💡 Solution

This AI agent consolidates **44 specialized tools** into a single conversational interface where you can:

- **Speak naturally**: "Show me the git status and stage all Python files"
- **Chain operations**: "Read config.json, update the version, and commit the changes"
- **Automate workflows**: "Analyze all code, find TODOs, create a zip backup, and push to remote"

### Core Capabilities

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Google Gemini API key ([Get one here](https://ai.google.dev/))

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ReginRavi/Agent.git
cd Agent

# Set your Gemini API key
export GEMINI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'

# Run the agent (auto-creates venv and installs dependencies)
./run.sh
```

The `run.sh` script automatically:
1. Creates a Python virtual environment
2. Installs required packages (`google-genai`)
3. Validates your API key
4. Starts the agent

## 🎨 Key Features

### 1. Natural Language Interface
No need to remember command syntax - just ask in plain English.

### 2. Chain Operations
The agent intelligently chains multiple tools to complete complex tasks.

### 3. Safety Built-in
- File size limits (10MB for reads, 1MB for searches)
- Command execution blocklist (prevents dangerous operations)
- Timeouts on all operations
- Input validation

### 4. Smart Error Handling
Every tool includes comprehensive error handling with helpful messages.

### 5. Conversational Personality
Responds like Linus Torvalds - direct, technical, and opinionated.

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Dangerous Command Blocking**: Prevents destructive commands like `rm -rf /`
- **File Size Limits**: Protects against memory exhaustion
- **Operation Timeouts**: All operations have reasonable timeouts
- **Input Validation**: Path validation and existence checks
- **Sandboxed Execution**: Commands run with 30s timeout limit

## 🔧 Configuration

### Optional Dependencies

For enhanced features:
```bash
# YAML support
pip install pyyaml

# Detailed system stats
pip install psutil
```

The agent can install these itself using its `install_package` tool!

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required
export GEMINI_API_KEY='your-key'

# Optional (defaults shown)
export AGENT_TIMEOUT=30        # Command timeout in seconds
export AGENT_MAX_FILE_SIZE=10  # Max file size in MB
```

## 📊 Statistics

- **Total Tools**: 44
- **Code Modules**: 10 (9 tool modules + 1 core)
- **Total Lines**: ~2,200
- **Main Agent**: 137 lines (89% reduction from monolithic design)
- **Test Coverage**: Manual verification across all tools

## 🚧 Roadmap

### Potential Future Enhancements
- [ ] Database operations (SQLite, PostgreSQL)
- [ ] Docker container management
- [ ] Testing framework integration
- [ ] Code refactoring tools
- [ ] AI-powered code review
- [ ] Multi-language support (beyond Python)

## 🌟 Why This Matters

In an age where developers use dozens of tools daily, this agent demonstrates that **conversational AI can unify common development workflows** into a single, intuitive interface. It's not about replacing existing tools - it's about making them accessible through natural language, reducing cognitive load, and focusing on what matters: building great software.
